"""Built-in command handlers for aish shell.

This module provides stateless command processing logic for shell built-in commands
like cd, pushd, popd, export, unset, etc.

The handlers are designed to be used by both:
- the interactive shell core (for user commands)
- BashTool (for AI-generated commands)
